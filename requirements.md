# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Personal AI Assistant App is a React Native mobile application that provides users with a voice-activated AI assistant experience. The app features a dark, elegant UI with a morphing voice button that transforms into a live waveform visualizer during audio capture. It includes real-time streaming transcription, chat history, and integration with a Python backend for AI processing. The app prioritizes smooth animations, low-latency voice interaction, and an intuitive user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to activate voice recording with a single tap, so that I can quickly interact with my AI assistant without complex navigation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user taps the microphone button THEN the app SHALL transition to listening state within 150ms
2. WHEN the app enters listening state THEN the microphone button SHALL morph into a waveform visualizer
3. WHEN the user taps the microphone button AND microphone permissions are not granted THEN the app SHALL prompt for permissions
4. WHEN the user denies microphone permissions THEN the app SHALL display an error message with retry option

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a live waveform visualization while speaking, so that I have visual feedback that the app is actively listening to my voice.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is in listening state THEN the waveform visualizer SHALL display real-time audio amplitude
2. WHEN the user speaks THEN the waveform amplitude SHALL react proportionally to voice volume
3. WHEN there is no audio input THEN the waveform SHALL display minimal baseline activity
4. WHEN transitioning from button to waveform THEN the animation SHALL be smooth and complete within 300ms
5. WHEN the waveform is active THEN it SHALL use exponential decay filtering for smooth amplitude transitions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see my speech transcribed in real-time, so that I can verify what the assistant is hearing and make corrections if needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user speaks THEN partial transcription results SHALL appear live during speech
2. WHEN the backend sends ASR partial results THEN the transcript view SHALL update immediately
3. WHEN the user stops speaking THEN the final transcript SHALL be displayed
4. WHEN transcription is active THEN the text SHALL appear with typewriter-style animation
5. WHEN there are transcription errors THEN the app SHALL display an error message and allow retry

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to automatically detect when I've finished speaking, so that I don't need to manually stop recording each time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user stops speaking for 2 seconds THEN the app SHALL automatically end recording
2. WHEN silence is detected THEN the app SHALL transition to processing state
3. WHEN in processing state THEN the app SHALL send the final transcript to the backend
4. WHEN voice activity is detected after silence THEN the silence timer SHALL reset
5. IF the user speaks continuously for more than 30 seconds THEN the app SHALL automatically segment the recording

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive AI assistant responses in a chat format, so that I can review the conversation history and context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend returns a response THEN it SHALL be displayed as a chat bubble
2. WHEN displaying responses THEN user messages SHALL be right-aligned and assistant messages left-aligned
3. WHEN a new message arrives THEN it SHALL be added to the chat history with timestamp
4. WHEN the chat history is long THEN the app SHALL automatically scroll to show the latest message
5. WHEN displaying assistant responses THEN the text SHALL appear with streaming typewriter effect

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the option to hear assistant responses spoken aloud, so that I can continue the conversation hands-free.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the assistant responds AND TTS is enabled THEN the response SHALL be spoken aloud
2. WHEN TTS is playing THEN the user SHALL be able to interrupt by tapping the microphone
3. WHEN TTS is disabled in settings THEN responses SHALL only be displayed as text
4. WHEN TTS fails THEN the app SHALL display the text response without audio
5. WHEN multiple responses queue up THEN only the latest response SHALL be spoken

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want a dark, elegant interface that matches modern design standards, so that the app is visually appealing and comfortable to use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app loads THEN it SHALL display a dark gradient background from purple to deep blue
2. WHEN displaying UI elements THEN they SHALL use appropriate contrast ratios for accessibility
3. WHEN the microphone button is idle THEN it SHALL display as a glowing orb
4. WHEN displaying text THEN it SHALL use light colors on the dark background
5. WHEN showing animations THEN they SHALL be smooth and maintain 60fps performance

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure app settings like ASR backend, TTS, and privacy options, so that I can customize the experience to my preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses settings THEN they SHALL be able to toggle TTS on/off
2. WHEN the user accesses settings THEN they SHALL be able to select ASR backend options
3. WHEN the user accesses settings THEN they SHALL see privacy and data handling information
4. WHEN settings are changed THEN they SHALL be persisted across app sessions
5. WHEN privacy settings are accessed THEN the app SHALL display data usage and retention policies

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to work reliably with network connectivity issues, so that I can still use basic features when offline.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the device is offline THEN the app SHALL display an offline mode indicator
2. WHEN offline AND the user tries to use voice features THEN the app SHALL show an appropriate message
3. WHEN network connectivity is restored THEN the app SHALL automatically reconnect to backend services
4. WHEN in offline mode THEN the app SHALL still allow viewing of cached chat history
5. IF offline ASR is available THEN the app SHALL provide basic transcription functionality

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a user, I want smooth real-time communication with the AI backend, so that conversations feel natural and responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN recording audio THEN the app SHALL stream audio data to backend via WebSocket
2. WHEN the backend processes audio THEN partial transcription results SHALL be received in real-time
3. WHEN the backend generates responses THEN they SHALL be streamed as tokens for live display
4. WHEN WebSocket connection fails THEN the app SHALL attempt automatic reconnection
5. WHEN network latency is high THEN the app SHALL display appropriate loading indicators
